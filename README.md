# Train-Time-HW
This app helps the user keep track of train schedules and tells the user when the next train is arriving after their input of the train info.

Using Jquery to capture the input of the user, the app then stores that input into firebase and uses moment.js to convert it from military time to standard time. The app uses an algorithm to then figure out when the next stop for the train is and how many minutes away that stop is from the current time. The app then displays each instance of data into a table for the user to see.

The user inputs a name for the train, the frequency, destination, and the time of the first train. The app then automates and stores all the info and tells the user what time the next train stop will be and how many minutes away it is from the current time.
